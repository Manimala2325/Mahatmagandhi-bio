    <p>Mahatma Gandhi, also known as the Father of the Nation in India, dedicated his life to fighting injustice and promoting peace through non-violence. He began his career as a lawyer in South Africa, where he experienced racial discrimination. This deeply influenced his beliefs and led him to develop the method of Satyagraha, or non-violent resistance. Returning to India in 1915, Gandhi became a key leader in the Indian independence movement. He led several major movements, including the Non-Cooperation Movement, Salt March, and Quit India Movement, all aimed at ending British rule. His career was not in politics or business, but in service to humanity, promoting truth, non-violence, and justice. Gandhi’s simple lifestyle and powerful ideas inspired people across the world and continue to influence leaders and movements even todayGandhi’s entire career was guided by the principles of Ahimsa (non-violence) and Satya (truth). He believed that real change could only come through peaceful means, not violence or hatred. Even when he was imprisoned several times, he remained calm and continued to fight for justice through peaceful protests and hunger strikes. His approach was spiritual and moral, aiming to change hearts rather than force people.</p>
