    <h3 id="carrer">Carrer</h3>
    <p>Choosing a carieer is a big decision and the irony is that we are not prepared to take such a big decision at the time we require taking it. We are still in our school when we have to choose between the science, commerce and humanities stream that mainly influences the career path we take up later. While earlier, it was parents, teachers and elder siblings who largely influenced our career choice, children these days have become more aware – thanks to the internet. We can expzlore the various available career options on the internet as well as their prospects before we make the final decision. However, advice from the elders is still recommended as they are more experienced.We must all be very careful while choosing our career. We must not enter a field just because our friend or sibling has taken it up or our parents want us to go for it. We should listen to our heart, understand what really interests us, see if we are good at it and then look forward to other aspects attached to it. The other aspects may include the cost involved in the course we wish to pursue.</p>
    <h3 id="goals">Goals</h3>
    <p>My goals in life are ultimately to achieve success in life. My goals are to also have happiness, prosperity in every area in my life, and the freedom and peace within to be able to carry out my goals. My goals are also heavily influenced on the hardships my parents have had to endure such as facing ridicule for the simple fact of being immigrants, the extremely difficult time they endured due to unemployment and living in poverty, and the low degree of education they received from their countries. My goals are so important to me because I view it as way out of barely getting by, out of a harder life. My goals consist of me being the first person on my mother 's side to ever graduate from middle and high school. My goals also consist of making my parents proud of their daughter, a daughter that will give them a more comfortable life, one that is not filled with such pain. After seeing my mother suffer from a liver infection which caused her to become sick to the point of hospitalization, I promised myself that day I never wanted anyone to feel as sick as my mother did. No one deserves to go through that much suffering.</p>
    <h3 id="achievements">Achievements</h3>
    <p>I have made many achievements in my life.  I am happy to be such an achiever at things. I remember my first achievement which was in kindergarten. In kindergarten I got on the honor roll for the first time. I was so happy, but I was just happy because my mom was happy. I didn’t even know what honor roll meant, but I finally founded out that is meant that I got all A’s. My mom was so happy for me, and I got lot of money for my A’s. After that my next achievement was that I learn how to ride a bike. When I first started to ride a bike with no training wheels I kept on falling. After I kept falling I didn’t want to learn anymore, but I saw that my little cousin was riding a bike, so I just had to learn how to ride a bike. Finally, after all the sores and burses, I learned how to ride a bike. I still fall every now and then. Well, as I began to get older I started to achieve more and more. When was 8 I started washing dish. That was a great achievement to me back then, but now I regret it. Now my mother makes me wash dish all the time.</p>
